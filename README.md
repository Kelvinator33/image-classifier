# 🖼️ Image Classification with CNNs

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify images into categories. The dataset is preprocessed using **OpenCV**, and the model is trained and evaluated with TensorFlow.

## 📌 Features
- Image preprocessing with **OpenCV**
- CNN architecture using **Keras Sequential API**
- Training visualization with **Matplotlib**
- Model evaluation using **Precision, Recall, and Accuracy**
- Saved and loaded trained model (`.h5` format)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **OpenCV**
- **Matplotlib**
- **NumPy**
